    "# How to use functions with a knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",
    "- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.\n",
    "- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook takes you through the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search utilities:** Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.\n",
    "- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.\n",
    "- **arXiv conversation:** Put all of this together in live conversation.\n"

In this paper, we replace policy gradient with proximal\\npolicy optimization (PPO), which is a proved more efficient reinforcement\\nlearning algorithm, and propose a dynamic approach for PPO (PPO-dynamic). We\\ndemonstrate the efficacy of PPO and PPO-dynamic on conditional sequence\\ngeneration tasks including synthetic experiment and chit-chat chatbot.
